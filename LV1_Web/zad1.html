        <h1>Bull</h1>
        <p>A bull is an intact (i.e., not castrated) adult male of the species Bos taurus (cattle). 
            More muscular and aggressive than the females of the same species (i.e., cows), 
            bulls have long been an important symbol in many religions, including for sacrifices. 
            These animals play a significant role in beef ranching, dairy farming, and a variety of sporting and cultural activities, 
            including bullfighting and bull riding. Their use in herd maintenance is part of their monetary value. 
            Due to their temperament, handling requires precautions.</p>
